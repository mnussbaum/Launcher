/// Caching handle for [ArcSwapAny].
///
/// Instead of loading (or leasing or something) the [Arc] on every request from the shared
/// storage, this keeps another copy inside. Upon request it only cheaply revalidates it is up to
/// date. If it is, access is significantly faster. If it is stale, the full [load] is done and the
/// cache value is replaced. Under a read-heavy loads, the measured speedup are 10-25 times,
/// depending on the architecture.
///
/// There are, however, downsides:
///
/// * The handle needs to be kept around by the caller (usually, one per thread). This is fine if
///   there's one global instance, but starts being tricky with eg. data structures build from
///   them.
/// * As it keeps a copy of the [Arc] inside the cache, the old value may be kept alive for longer
///   period of time â€’ it is replaced by the new value on [load][Cache::load]. You may not want to
///   use this if dropping the old value in timely manner is important (possibly because of
///   releasing large amount of RAM or because of closing file handles).
///
